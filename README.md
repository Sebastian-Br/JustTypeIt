# JustTypeIt

This is an applicated designed to help language learners overcome the astronomical challenges inherent to finding the groundbreaking technology necessary
to write down and check words. Yes. Me and NASA's top engineers worked tirelessly, which culminated in this masterpiece of UI design.
<br>
Jokes aside, I was just making my first training set of Russian vocabulary on Quizlet. The NEXT DAY, they decided to make their "write mode" a paid feature. For only 7.99€ a month, you can now access mankind's greatest invention (the string comparer).
<br>
But thou shall fear no longer; remedy is nigh! And thus, at 1AM, May 19th, 2022, I created a new XAML project (which I'm not very experienced at).
<br>
Two hours later (or, had I been more experienced: 30 minutes later), the impossible had been achieved. Now the world no longer needs 7.99€ - it has JustTypeIt. You just type. It. A word's definition, that is.
<br><br>
### Q: BUT MY INTRICATE VOCAB SETS ARE STUCK IN THE DEPTHS OF QUIZLET'S SERVERS?!
<br>
A: Click "More", "Export" and set ";" (semi colon) as the separator. Currently, JustTypeIt can only parse files that were generated this way. If you've got a semi colon anywhere in your set, you might be out of luck, sorry, a "matching" (haha!) feature is planned to be released some time this century, most likely.
Save the contents of whatever quizlet generated (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C) into a file; remember the file location.
<br>

## Importing your Vocab Set
<br>
Open JTI, in the upper left corner, click "Load Configuration", and select the file you just created. Currently, the app does not thoroughly check whether it actually parsed the file correctly (I once "successfully parsed" an MP3 file on accident!); so, there's that ;).
ETA for that fix is the second next time that C/2017 K2 will pass or crash into earth.
